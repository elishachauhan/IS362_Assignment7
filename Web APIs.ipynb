    "After signing up for a key for a specific API, JSON data that is embedded within an API can be retrieved and organized in a pandas DataFrame. In this case, the most popular API contains information on the most emailed, most shared, and most viewed articles for different sections as well as all sections. Data can be retrieved from different URLs that can modified to have different sections and different time periods. For example, I used /mostviewed/Technology/30.json that contains the most viewed technology articles in the past 30 days. After building the interface with the URL and API key, I loaded it onto a pandas DataFrame that read the top 11 viewed technology articles. Since the resulting table only shows copyright information, the number of results, and the URL for the article, I decided to check the other columns in the schema. In order to check the other columns, I utilized json.loads() to load the API data and normalized the data into a table. To organize the data further, I sorted the values by views in descending order.
